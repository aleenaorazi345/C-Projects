TASK 1
CGPA Calculator - Console Based Project

 Overview
 
The CGPA Calculator is a console-based application developed in C++ to help students calculate their CGPA. It collects user inputs for grades and credit hours per subject, computes the GPA for each semester, and calculates the overall CGPA.

Features

1. User-Friendly Interface: Simple, step-by-step console prompts.
2. Multiple Semester Support: Handles inputs for multiple semesters.
3. Grade and Credit Input: Accepts grades and credit hours for each subject.
4. GPA and CGPA Calculation: Computes semester GPAs and overall CGPA.
5. Error Handling: Manages invalid inputs and provides correction prompts.

 How It Works
1. Input Data: Users enter the number of semesters and their respective grades and credit hours.
2. Calculate: The program calculates GPAs for each semester and the overall CGPA.



TASK 2
Overview

The Banking System is a console-based application developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates basic banking operations, providing users with functionalities to manage their accounts efficiently.

Features

Account Management: Create, view, update, and delete accounts.
Transactions: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and check balances.
OOP Concepts: Utilizes classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Data Persistence: Saves account information for future sessions.
User Authentication: Secure login for account access.

How It Works
Account Creation: Users can create accounts by providing necessary details.
Transaction Handling: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
OOP Implementation: Classes represent accounts, users, and transactions, encapsulating related data and behaviors.
This project provides a practical demonstration of OOP principles in a real-world application, making it a valuable learning tool for C++ developers.

TASK 3
Overview
The Login and Registration System is a console-based application developed in C++ focused on user registration and authentication. It prompts users for credentials, and upon successful registration, creates a unique file for each user in the database, ensuring secure storage of user information.

Features

User Registration: Collects and stores usernames and passwords securely.
User Login: Verifies credentials for user access.
File Creation: Creates a dedicated file for each registered user in the database.
Data Persistence: Ensures user data is saved and accessible in future sessions.
Security: Basic encryption methods for password storage to enhance security.
How It Works

Registration Process: Users provide a username and password, which are then validated and stored. A unique file is created for each user in the database.
Login Process: Users enter their credentials, which are checked against the stored data for authentication.
File Handling: Each userâ€™s credentials are securely saved in a separate file, demonstrating file handling and data persistence in C++.
